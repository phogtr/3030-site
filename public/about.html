        <h3 class="ln-height">Our team, JPMAN Gaming Studios, consists of 5 members and the game was developed
          using the Godot engine.
          We wanted to make a game that was similar to other platformers to make it familiar to players of classics
          like Mario or Megaman. However, we wanted to create our own gameplay elements to make it unique.
          This includes the story, stage locations, unlockable attacks/spells, and more.
          We also wanted to explore the basics of the Godot engine and see what we could do in terms of
          creating a platformer.</h3>

        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><b>Role: </b>Programmer, Tower and Final Boss Developer, Music Composer,
          Spell
          Developer</h3>
        <p class="p-text">
          Hi everyone, Jeremy here! I’m a senior and soon-to-be graduate from UCI. By the time you read this, I will
          have obtained my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science. I’ve always been fascinated by video games ever since
          my preschool years. The very first game I played was Super Smash Bros. on the original Nintendo 64 and have
          been hooked ever since. I have always wanted to develop a platformer and I am very proud about how this
          project turned out. My main job was developing spells for players to use in the game. I was also in charge of
          a few random tasks. This included composing the music, developing the Tower stage and final battle, and
          drawing spells/spell pickups. I am glad that I was able to experiment with music composition and would like to
          create more tracks in the future. Speaking of the Tower, did you find the super secret in your adventure?
          Somewhere deep in the Tower is a mysterious artifact that makes your spells more powerful! You can see it near
          the end of the 3030 trailer. Trust your Earth magic to find the pit that is actually a path… I hope that you
          will enjoy our game!

          Hi! I’m Nayeri, and I am a computer science major at the University of California, Irvine. I do not consider
          myself a gamer, but I was very curious to learn about the gaming world; therefore, I joined this group to
          develop 3030. I designed the Ghost Town level, most of the enemies in that stage (ghosts and rats), and some
          of the platforms.

          Hi, I am Phong Tran. I am a senior student at the University of California, Irvine and my major is computer
          science. I have played a lot of video games and I enjoy playing all types of different video games such as:
          shooting, rpg, moba, platformer, etc. I am also interested in web development, specifically the front-end. I
          decided to join this development team because I wanted to apply my creativity and my experience of developing
          the web into an application or a game. Most of my contribution for this game is the user interface, and I am
          also responsible for designing the fire stage level. I also did the little fading effects for transitioning
          between the scenes and the flashing-red effect whenever the player took the damages. I would like to thank
          Miriya from our team for designing the fire-falling in the fire stage level and all the objects such as the
          woods, the stones, etc as well.

        <p class="p-text">
          Hello everyone, I am An Nguyen, a junior student majoring in computer science at the University of California,
          Irvine. I’ve been playing videos ever since I was six years old. The very first game I could remember playing
          was a racing game in MS-DOS. Joining this development team is a great opportunity for me to experience and
          understand more about many fascinating things like pixel art design, and enemy AI. My main role was to develop
          Marlious, the main character, and enemies namely, skeleton, bat, firebird, and slime. Also, I was so glad that
          I implemented the tornado, which was taken from Miriya’s design and idea, into the storm stage. The tornado
          could be your enemy or your ally; you may find it annoying but sometimes it may be your lifesaver.

          Hi everyone, my name is Miriya Higa and I am a computer science major at the University of California, Irvine.
          I have always been a fan of both console and PC games but this is the first game I helped develop! I coded the
          player’s and enemies’ health bar and designed the poison stage level. I also designed most of the platforms
          and obstacles that the player can run across. Some of these include the poisonous mushrooms, the tree stumps
          and branches, and the tornados found in the storm stage. Another task that I helped with was setting up the
          backgrounds of the ghost town, the fire stage, the storm stage, and the poisonous forest stage.
